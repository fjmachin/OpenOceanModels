OpenOceanModels 🌊

OpenOceanModels is an open-access project aimed at making oceanographic modeling a valuable resource for teaching and learning physical oceanography. By combining open-source tools and a commitment to accessibility, this initiative provides practical exercises to simulate and visualize oceanographic processes like wave dynamics, currents, and more.
Features 🚀

    Hands-on Exercises: Explore fundamental oceanographic concepts through practical coding exercises.
    Open-Source Tools: Leverage powerful tools like Fortran 95, Scilab, and Python to simulate ocean dynamics.
    Open Access Philosophy: All materials are freely available to encourage learning and collaboration.

Why "Open"? 🌐

The "open" in OpenOceanModels reflects our commitment to:

    Open Source: Using free, accessible software.
    Open Access: Sharing knowledge and resources with the scientific and educational community.

Recommended Software 📦

You can use any of the following tools based on your preference:

    Fortran 95: Ideal for computation-intensive tasks. Ensure compatibility mode for Windows prior to version 8.
    Scilab: A multipurpose software for coding, graphics, and animations.
    Python: Versatile and popular, with strong visualization and coding capabilities. We recommend the lightweight Conda distribution.

Note: It’s not necessary to install all three tools—select the one that best fits your needs.
